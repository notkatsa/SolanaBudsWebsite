					<h2>Our Roadmap</h2>
					<p>Our goal is to create a strong and healthy community of smokers from all around the globe. We have already completed a phase in our roadmap by creating these 3D Characters that each feel unique and full of life. We plan on hosting AMAs and lots of events to ensure all the members have a great time.</p>

									<h4>Launch - Minting</h4>
									<p>4200 SolBuds are going to be released onto the Solana blockchain. We will be having a Whitelist sale exclusively for @Bud List members. After our Public Launch we will get listed on Marketplaces and create a special community for our holders.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="map_item">
									<h4>The DAO</h4>
									<p> The DAO aka our community wallet is going to be something that only our SolBud holders are going to have access to it. With 50% of the royalties being funded into it each month, our holders are going to be able to choose what to do with the money via voting.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="map_item">
									<h4>Other utilities</h4>
									<p>Our holders will have Alpha Calls from the best in the industry. We will also be doing some giveaways and many collaborations with nft projects so that we can provide our holders as many whitelist spots as possible..</p>
								</div>
								<div class="map_item">
									<h4>WE ARE HERE TO STAY</h4>
									<p>This is the start of our journey and we are glad that you are here to grow with us!</p>
